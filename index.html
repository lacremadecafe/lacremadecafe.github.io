This spring scented parfum was called to wake you up
Reminiscing on these memories that were trapped inside this love

The enlightenment of life to evoke you
Making light noises
To show there is hope

Revive the flower of this singing voice who dances
The old feelings that are in full bloom
Creating a fragrant drop of warmth
Yearning for it with impatience

While being perished in this longing and illusion
While anticipating this sleeping Hermitage

Someday, your heart will blow and you'll kiss me
In this eternity

This Lumiere in the spring is a certain warmth that won't disappear

Through this glass, this moment was interrupted
Three times it moved
The fate we encountered


Revive now the singing voice is budding
This perpetual thing is the feelings that were hidden
Full of grace and brilliance
That is the future we dream for

Holding on to these rusted, broken, and lonely feelings
Getting close to this person in Hermitage

Someday, these arms will embrace me tightly
In this eternity
